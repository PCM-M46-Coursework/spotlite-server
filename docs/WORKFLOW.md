# Trello First Workflow

The basic idea of the Trello First Workflow is that at each step of your work, you all Trello to be the first action you take. Before making a branch, before writing code, before making a pull request, before calling it done.

The workflow breaks down like this:

## Before:

1. Choose a number of tasks from the Tasks Backlog, and assign them to yourself, by right-clicking on the card, selecting “Change Members”, and adding a checkmark your name.

2. Drag and drop your assigned cards into the Currently Assigned column.

## During:

3. Drag and drop each card into the In Progress column, as you start each card.

## Pull Request:

4. Once your work is ready for a pull request, drag and drop your card into the Code Review column. Keep an eye on GitHub, and on Trello while your Code Review goes through. If any changes are needed, the cards will be placed into the Pending Changes column, with a comment to explain the issue that needs resolving.

## Done:

5. Once your work has been reviewed, and merged back into the dev branch, your cards can then be moved to the Done column.
