This repository contains our coursework submission for Weeks 11, and 12 of the [Master Coding](https://wearecodenation.com/2022/04/25/master-coding/) course at *CodeNation*.

## Brief

**Overview:**

For the next 2 weeks you will be working on a full stack MERN application, combining everything you have learnt over the past 12 weeks.

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

 - MongoDB - document database – If your group wishes you can use SQL with Sequelize as your database.
 - Express(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server.
 - Node(.js) - Node.js web framework. 
 - React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework.
 - Your group may also use any npm packages or any other Technologies you wish.
 - Your group should also use GitHub, and Trello (or similar) effectively.

 ### Minium Requirements

 **Front End**
 
 Your front end must be built with React and have the following components:
 
 - [ ] A login and sign-up page.
 - [ ] A manual log out button. That once pressed should display or redirect back to the login page / component
 - [ ] Once logged in have a component or page that displays dynamic information about that user, for example their username or email.
 - [ ] Once logged in successfully display a response from a free API for example the IMDb API – (Only show this if a user has logged in correctly).
 - [ ] A component or page that displays all the registered users on your app.
 - [ ] A component or page that allows a user to update their username, password and email.
 - [ ] A button so a user can delete their account.
 - [ ] Nicely styled and have some thought to styling and UX/UI design.

**Back End**

Your REST API must be built using Node, Express and have a database layer with routes, middleware and controllers to handle all the CRUD operations.

 - [ ] Login – use password hashing and generate JWT tokens where appropriate.
 - [ ] Sign Up – use password hashing and generate JWT tokens where appropriate.
 - [ ] Update user information – use password hashing and generate JWT tokens where
appropriate.
 - [ ] List users – use password hashing and generate JWT tokens where appropriate.
 - [ ] Delete a user and generate JWT tokens where appropriate.

**Stretch Goals**
 - [ ] Project all your API routes using JWT Tokens.
 - [ ] Your application must also be hosted on Netlify and Render (or similar).
 - [ ] Persistent login using JWT tokens.
